# Motion-Compensated Video Filter

This project is a python implementation of a **motion-compensated video filter** made for the Signal, Image and Video course at UNITN (🇮🇹).

### 🚀 Teacher guidelines
- Python as coding language
- It must accept settings parameters as input variables (eventually from a file or from the command line) and it must generate an output
- The software must be accompanied by a report in which it is summarized what is necessary to make the filter works (libraries, Python version, etc.) and some commented graphic examples
- Software and report must be delivered 1 week before the exam
- The exam will be a 10 minute presentation about the work done

### ⚙️ Requirements

- `Python 3.8.6`
- `Numpy 1.19.4`

### 🔧 How to use

- Clone the repository `https://github.com/sebastianochiari/SIV-project`
- Install all the dependencies listed above

### 📜 Report
The report `da inserire` includes some theory behind the functioning of the filter and all the details about the implementation.
